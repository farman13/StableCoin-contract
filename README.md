# Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) & DSCEngine

A fully decentralized, algorithmic, and overcollateralized stablecoin system designed for stability and security. DSC (Decentralized Stablecoin) is pegged to USD and backed by exogenous collateral like ETH & BTC.

## Features
- **Collateral:** Exogenous (ETH & BTC)
- **Minting:** Algorithmic
- **Relative Stability:** Pegged to USD

## DSCEngine Responsibilities
âœ… **200% Collateralization** â€“ Users must deposit collateral worth twice the DSC they mint.
âœ… **Chainlink Price Feeds** â€“ Ensures real-time USD valuation of collateral.
âœ… **Liquidation Mechanism** â€“ Under-collateralized positions can be liquidated to maintain stability.
âœ… **Minting & Burning** â€“ Users can mint DSC against collateral and burn DSC to redeem collateral.
âœ… **Health Factor Enforcement** â€“ Maintains collateral safety ratios to prevent excessive risk.

## Tech Stack
- **Smart Contract Framework:** Foundry
- **Oracles:** Chainlink Price Feeds
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum
